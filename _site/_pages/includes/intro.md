# About Me

I work at ByteDance Seed, as a senior research scientist and a member of TopSeed program. 
I am working on advancing reasoning capability (like O1) of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Agent foundation model. 
We are hiring **research interns** and looking for **academic cooperation**, please feel free to email me at [wanjun@bytedance.com](mailto:wanjun@bytedance.com)

Prior to that, I worked at [Huawei Noah's Ark Lab](http://dev3.noahlab.com.hk/) as a research scientist and a member of Huawei TopMind program.
I received my Ph.D. degree from the [School of Computer Science and Engineering](http://sdcs.sysu.edu.cn/) in [Sun Yat-sen University (SYSU)](http://www.sysu.edu.cn/en/index.htm), as a member of [joint Ph.D. program](https://www.msra.cn/zh-cn/connections/academic-programs/joint-phd) between SYSU and Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA).

As a joint Ph.D. student, I was advised by [Dr. Ming Zhou](https://scholar.google.co.jp/citations?user=a0w5c0gAAAAJ&hl=en), [Prof. Jian Yin](http://sdcs.sysu.edu.cn/content/2505) and [Prof. Jiahai Wang](http://sdcs.sysu.edu.cn/content/2551). I was a research intern in the Natural Language Computing Group of MSRA, and was mentored by [Dr. Nan Duan](https://nanduan.github.io/)

I won the [Microsoft Research Fellowship Award](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/academic-program/phd-fellowship/#!people) (11 outstanding Ph.D. in Asia-Pacific area each year) in 2021, and is selected as a member of [Huawei TopMind program](https://career.huawei.com/reccampportal/portal5/topminds.html) in 2023. 

I published over 40+ papers in top-tier AI conferences and journals, including NeurIPS, ICLR, ACL, EMNLP, TASLP, NAACL, AAAI, IJCAI, ISSTA, etc.
